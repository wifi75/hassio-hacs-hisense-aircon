# HiSense Air Conditioners

Native Home Assistant custom integration for Hisense/Ayla LAN air conditioners.

This repository is now structured for HACS. It no longer runs as a Docker container, Home Assistant add-on, MQTT bridge, or external Python service. Home Assistant hosts the local Ayla LAN endpoints directly and communicates with the device on your local network.

This integration implements the Ayla Networks LAN API used by many HiSense WiFi air conditioner modules, including AEH-W4B1 and AEH-W4E1 devices, and Fujitsu FGLair devices.

As discussed in the upstream project issue [deiger/AirCon#1](https://github.com/deiger/AirCon/issues/1), the AEH-W4A1 module appears to use a different protocol. That module is used by apps such as [Hi-Smart Life](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.qd.android.livehome), [AirConnect](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oem.android.airconnect), [Smart Cool](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oem.android.livehome), [AC WIFI](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oem.android.ecold), and [Tornado WiFi](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.oem.android.tornadowifi). If your module is AEH-W4A1, this integration may not work with it.

These modules are installed in air conditioners and humidifiers manufactured or branded by several companies, including Hisense, Beko, Westinghouse, Winia, Tornado, York, and others.

**This project is not affiliated with Hisense, Ayla Networks, Fujitsu, any of their subsidiaries, or any of their resellers.**

## What This Integration Does

- Adds devices through the normal Home Assistant config flow.
- Discovers LAN keys from the supported Hisense/Ayla cloud account, or accepts manual LAN key entry.
- Registers unauthenticated local LAN endpoints under `/local_lan/...` so the air conditioner can exchange encrypted local messages with Home Assistant.
- Exposes the main device as a `climate` entity.
- Exposes additional writable properties as `switch`, `select`, and `number` entities.
- Exposes read-only device properties as `sensor` and `binary_sensor` entities.
- Does not require MQTT.

## Prerequisites

1. A supported air conditioner or humidifier with a HiSense AEH-W4B1/AEH-W4E1 module, or a supported Fujitsu FGLair device.
2. The device must already be configured in its original mobile app and connected to your network.
3. The device must be reachable from Home Assistant on the local network.
4. Home Assistant must be reachable by the air conditioner over plain HTTP on the configured callback port, usually `8123`.
5. Pick the app code for the mobile app you used to configure the device:

After the integration has fetched the LAN key, the device can usually be blocked from the internet as long as it can still reach Home Assistant locally. If you plan to give the device a static IP address, do that while the original app can still see the device, then use the same IP in Home Assistant.

## Install Using HACS (Recommended)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=cvladan&repository=hassio-hacs-hisense-aircon&category=integration)

Open your Home Assistant instance and open this repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.

To add it manually:

1. Open **HACS**.
2. Go to **Integrations**.
3. Open the three-dot menu and choose **Custom repositories**.
4. Add `https://github.com/cvladan/hassio-hacs-hisense-aircon`.
5. Select category **Integration**.
6. Click **Download** for **Hisense Air Conditioner**.

After installing, restart Home Assistant. Then open **Settings -> Devices & services -> Add integration** and search for **Hisense Air Conditioner**.

## Supported Setup Methods

### Cloud Discovery

Use this if the device is still visible in the original mobile app.

1. Install the integration through HACS as a custom repository.
2. Restart Home Assistant.
3. Go to **Settings -> Devices & services -> Add integration**.
4. Search for **Hisense Air Conditioner**.
5. Choose **Discover from Hisense app**.
6. Enter:
   - app code, for example `hisense-eu`, `hisense-us`, `fglair-eu`
   - app username
   - app password
7. Select one or more discovered air conditioners to add. All discovered devices are selected by default.

Advanced settings are optional and can usually stay collapsed:

- device name filter, if you want discovery to look for only one exact app device name
- Home Assistant HTTP port, usually `8123`
- optional Home Assistant local IP if HA has multiple network interfaces or VLANs
- device temperature unit override, if the automatic app-code detection reports the wrong unit

### Manual LAN Key Setup

Use this if you already know the device LAN key and key ID.

Enter:

- device name
- app code
- device IP address
- MAC address
- `lanip_key`
- `lanip_key_id`
- model
- temperature unit
- Home Assistant HTTP port
- optional Home Assistant local IP

## Network Notes

The air conditioner must be able to reach Home Assistant by plain HTTP on the configured port. The integration registers these local endpoints:

- `/local_lan/key_exchange.json`
- `/local_lan/commands.json`
- `/local_lan/property/datapoint.json`
- `/local_lan/property/datapoint/ack.json`
- `/local_lan/node/property/datapoint.json`
- `/local_lan/node/property/datapoint/ack.json`

For a quick browser check after the integration is loaded, open any endpoint directly. It will return a small JSON explanation when the browser method is not the real device protocol call. The `/local_lan/commands.json` endpoint is special: the air conditioner uses `GET` there, so browser checks from non-device IP addresses get the explanation while requests from the configured air conditioner IP get the real command response.

If Home Assistant has several IP addresses or VLAN interfaces, set the **Home Assistant local IP address** option explicitly.

## Supported App Codes

Common codes include:

- `hisense-eu`
- `hisense-us`
- `hismart-eu`
- `hismart-us`
- `fglair-eu`
- `fglair-us`
- `field-us`
- `oem-eu`
- `oem-us`
- `mid-eu`
- `mid-us`
- `tornado-us`
- `york-us`
- `beko-eu`
- `denali-us`
- `fglair-cn`
- `haxxair`
- `huihe-us`
- `winia-us`
- `wwh-us`

The full list is available in `custom_components/hisense_aircon/app_mappings.py`.

## Available Properties

The table below lists the main standard A/C properties available through the local protocol. FGLair devices and humidifiers expose different property sets, but Home Assistant will still create entities from whatever writable/read-only properties are known for that device class.

Home Assistant entity names are cleaned up from the raw protocol names. For example, `t_fan_leftright` is shown as **Horizontal Swing**, `t_fan_mute` as **Quiet**, and `f_e_intemp` as **Indoor Temperature Sensor Fault**. The original protocol property is still available on each entity as the `hisense_property` attribute, and the More info panel includes a short `description` attribute explaining what that entity controls or reports.

Protocol prefixes mean:

- `t_`: writable target/control property sent to the air conditioner
- `f_`: read-only feedback/status property reported by the air conditioner
- `f_e_`: read-only fault/error flag reported by the air conditioner

## Credits

The LAN protocol implementation is based on the original Ayla/Hisense AirCon project logic and has been repackaged as a native Home Assistant custom integration.

This project is not affiliated with Hisense, Ayla Networks, Fujitsu, or their subsidiaries.

## Technical Notes

This integration uses Home Assistant's shared `aiohttp` client session and HTTP view stack. `aiohttp` is managed by Home Assistant itself and is not pinned in this integration's `manifest.json` requirements.
